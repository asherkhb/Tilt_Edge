# Tilt, on the Edge

Use an edge device to monitor & broadcast from [Tilt Hydrometer](https://tilthydrometer.com/).

Running on the Rasperry Pi Zero W, which has both bluetooth and wifi and costs a whopping $10.
Deplyed using the [balena.io](https://www.balena.io) Cloud IOT platform, which offers a free tier of up to 10 devices.

Why not just use Tilt Pi? Because I wanted to do it this way instead.
